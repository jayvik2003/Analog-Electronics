## Mini-Project: R-2R Ladder DAC on a Breadboard
As part of this course, a practical project was completed to design and implement an R-2R Ladder Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) on a breadboard. This project involved:
- **Designing the R-2R Ladder Network:** Understanding the principles behind R-2R DACs and their implementation.
- **Assembling the Circuit:** Placing resistors and other components on a breadboard to construct the DAC.
- **Testing and Validation:** Connecting the DAC to a Digital signal generator and observing the analog output for different digital inputs.
